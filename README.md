**Deep Learning and Human Technology Semester Project**
This repository contains the code and results for the semester project completed as part of the **Deep Learning and Human Technology** course.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project explores the application of **modern language models** in analyzing and processing textual data. We experiment with both **small and large transformer-based models** to evaluate performance in language understanding tasks. The project employs **`smple-prompt`** and **few-shot learning** techniques to maximize the performance of the models.

The models implemented include:

* **SmolLM-135M**
* **SmolLM-360M**
* **BERT**
* **DistilBERT**
* **TurkuNLP/finnish-modernbert-large**
